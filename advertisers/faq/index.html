<h2 id="how-are-ads-priced">How are ads priced?</h2>
<p>We have <a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/advertisers/#packages">packages to simplify advertising with
us</a>, but you can always put
together a custom ad campaign. The exact cost will depend on your
targeting with geography being the biggest factor. See our
<a href="https://assets.readthedocs.org/sustainability/Read%20the%20Docs%20Advertising%20Prospectus.pdf">prospectus</a>
for details.</p>
<h2 id="can-i-post-an-ad-promoting-my-job-openings">Can I post an ad promoting my job openings?</h2>
<p>Absolutely. We have <a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/advertisers/hiring/">packages specifically to help you find
developers</a>.</p>
<h2 id="how-can-i-target-my-ads">How can I target my ads?</h2>
<p>In line with our <a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/advertising-vision/">ethical advertising
approach</a>,
we believe that ads can be well targeted while respecting users'
privacy. We only target based on a user's country and the content
of the page where the ad is served.
For ads targeting the USA, we also support targeting by state.</p>
<p>Advertisers may also target ads by topics.
Currently, these topics are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data science and machine learning</li>
<li>Backend web development</li>
<li>Frontend web development</li>
<li>Security and privacy</li>
<li>DevOps</li>
<li>Technical writing</li>
</ul>
<p>Our
<a href="https://assets.readthedocs.org/sustainability/Read%20the%20Docs%20Advertising%20Prospectus.pdf">prospectus</a>
will have the latest details and rates on keyword targeting.
More niche targeting is possible although campaigns may take longer to fulfill due to availability. Inquire for details.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-ad-specifications">What are the ad specifications?</h2>
<p>There are two main ad placements across the EthicalAds network.
We support unobtrusive text &amp; image placements which use a 240 * 180px image
(displayed at 120 * 90) and up to 100 characters of supporting text.
There's also a text-only placement that uses up to 100 characters without an image.
Publishers choose which placement best fits with their site
and we have seen great performance for advertisers and publishers with both types.</p>
<p>Our
<a href="https://assets.readthedocs.org/sustainability/Read%20the%20Docs%20Advertising%20Prospectus.pdf">prospectus</a>
has the full details and example screenshots.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-process-for-becoming-a-publisher">What is the process for becoming a publisher?</h2>
<p>The process generally follows these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>You fill out our <a href="/publishers/#inbound-form">publisher form</a> which lets us know you're interested.</li>
<li>We reply via email, telling you if you'd be a good fit. If so, we ask a few questions and confirm you want a publisher account.</li>
<li>You reply, confirming you want a publisher account.</li>
<li>We create an account for you, and send you an invite for our publisher dashboard. We also send you information about integrating the ads, which will show test ads to start.</li>
<li>You integrate the ads in your site, and let us know so we can review the placement.</li>
<li>We review the placement on your site, and then turn on paid ads for your account.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="where-do-the-ads-link-to">Where do the ads link to?</h2>
<p>The ads can link to any URL. Typically they will link to your
landing page on your website. You may include UTM parameters or
other URL parameters to know that the traffic came from your ad on
our site.</p>
<h2 id="how-are-my-ads-scheduled">How are my ads scheduled?</h2>
<p>We attempt to schedule advertising evenly based on the length and
size of your campaign. However, if you want to advertise as fast as
possible, we can definitely do that.</p>
<h2 id="can-i-run-my-ad-javascript">Can I run my ad JavaScript?</h2>
<p>In order to respect our users' privacy, we do not allow any
third-party ad scripts.</p>
<h2 id="how-can-i-see-how-my-ads-are-performing">How can I see how my ads are performing?</h2>
<p>Once you become an advertiser with us, you will have access to view
live reports on the performance of your ads including how many times
they were viewed and clicked. We count a viewable impression when
the ad comes into the browser viewport.</p>
<h2 id="how-can-i-manage-my-ads">How can I manage my ads?</h2>
<p>After you become an advertiser, you will get access to our advertising platform
where you can create, change, or turn off your ads as well as see live reports broken down by each ad.</p>
<h2 id="where-do-my-ads-appear">Where do my ads appear?</h2>
<p>Ads appear on sites that belong to our publisher network. Placement
is customizable based on their requirements, but we always ensure
a valuable placement.</p>
<h2 id="what-type-of-ads-are-acceptable">What type of ads are acceptable?</h2>
<p>We want ads that are of interest to our audience of millions of
software developers.</p>
<p>EthicalAds has final approval for all ads with respect to
editorial and creative content but generally this isn't an issue.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-details-of-the-ethicalads-audience">What are the details of the EthicalAds audience?</h2>
<p>EthicalAds is 100% software developers of varying skill levels.
Our peak traffic times for each region is during business hours and
many people reading the docs are doing so while building software
professionally.</p>

guide</a>.</p>
<h2 id="do-my-ads-support-open-source">Do my ads support open source?</h2>
<p>EthicalAds is open source software and the ads go to support
development of the publishers where ads are hosted.</p>
<h2 id="how-can-i-get-started-advertising">How can I get started advertising?</h2>
