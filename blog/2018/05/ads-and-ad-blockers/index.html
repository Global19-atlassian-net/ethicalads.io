<p>This post first appeared
on the <a href="https://blog.readthedocs.com/ads-and-adblocking/">Read the Docs company blog</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Last time, we shared how
<a href="https://www.ethicalads.io/blog/2018/04/ethical-advertising-works/">ethical advertising works</a>
to keep Read the Docs sustainable without creepy ad
targeting. This time, we will share about one of our biggest challenges
with advertising. At the beginning of April, Read the Docs was added to
one of the most popular ad block lists: the
<a href="https://easylist.to/">Easylist</a>.</p>
<h2 id="ad-blocker-fallout">Ad blocker fallout</h2>
<p><img src="https://www.ethicalads.io/images/posts/2018-readthedocs-adblocker-fallout.png" class="mw-100" alt="Effect of ad blocking on Read the Docs ad views"></p>
<p>Getting added to the EasyList had a significant and immediate impact on
the bottom line at Read the Docs. Right around April 1, <strong>32% of our ad
views simply vanished</strong>. At first, we thought we had done something
horribly wrong but then we discovered that this was due entirely to ad
blocking. Our actual traffic wasn't down at all.</p>
<p>Users' browsers were simply downloading the updated EasyList which
blocked ads on Read the Docs. In terms of ad viewership, weekdays --
our busiest days and the peaks in the graph -- became more like weekends
and weekends fell off a cliff. We had always guessed what percentage of
our user base ran ad blockers. Now we know. We knew this day would come
as we became more successful but we had hoped it was a ways off
considering we weren't part of a large ad network.</p>
<p>This directly affected our operations and staff. Our operating costs
didn't go down in any significant way, but revenue sure did.
Advertising is by far the largest source of revenue at Read the Docs and
it just dropped by about a third. This meant that we had to cut some
costs where we could and slow down some hiring plans. While Read the
Docs is not a non-profit company, all the revenue is reinvested into the
project itself, paying maintainers, and other places in the open source
ecosystem. The situation is not dire by any means, but it was certainly
disappointing that we ended up on the same list with popup advertisers
who couldn't care less about privacy.</p>
<h2 id="all-about-ad-blockers">All about ad blockers</h2>
<p>Ad blockers fulfill a legitimate need to mitigate the <a href="https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ethical-advertising.html">significant
downsides of
advertising</a>
from tracking across the internet, security implications of third-party
code, and impacting the UX and performance of sites.</p>
<p>At Read the Docs, we specifically didn't want those things. That's why
we built the ad network we wanted to exist with only relevant ads and no
creepy behavioral targeting.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://pagefair.com/downloads/2017/01/PageFair-2017-Adblock-Report.pdf">2017 report from
PageFair</a>
(pdf), a company that specializes in quantifying ad blocking, 11% of
global web users run an ad blocker. Considering that Read the Docs'
core audience is tech-savvy, privacy-conscious developers, it should be
no surprise that our number is higher.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-we-doing-about-it">What are we doing about it</h2>
<p>It will be an uphill battle to get back to where we were in terms of
revenue and sustaining Read the Docs, here are a few things we are
working on:</p>
<ul>
<li>We applied to the <a href="https://acceptableads.com/">acceptable ads</a> list,
    an ad block list enabled on many ad blockers by default that enables
    some unobtrusive advertising. We are very hopeful here but it does
    take quite a bit longer to get on this list than it does to get
    blocked.</li>
<li>Nagging users into allowing ads on Read the Docs. We are envisioning
    more of a polite nag in a similar vein to
    <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/">jsfiddle</a> rather than an \"adblock wall\"
    which prevents usage of Read the Docs until it's allowed.</li>
<li>Blogging and raising awareness of how ad blocking affects us and
    other open source projects.</li>
</ul>
<p>While we could simply change our CSS and ad API to avoid blocking since
we host our ads ourselves, we decided not to engage in a cat and mouse
game since this work would not benefit users.</p>
<p>Advertising funds much of the web and many people recognize that while
there are plenty of bad actors in the ad industry -- think pop-under ad
networks or ads that navigate your browser for you -- some advertising
is necessary to power the web we know and love especially when it comes
to open source software which has <a href="https://www.fordfoundation.org/library/reports-and-studies/roads-and-bridges-the-unseen-labor-behind-our-digital-infrastructure/">unique funding
challenges</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: On May 4th, Read the Docs was added to the acceptable ads
list! We will collect data over the next couple weeks and have a
follow-up post on what effects this had on advertising.</p>
<h2 id="open-source-advertising-list">Open source advertising list</h2>
<p>At Read the Docs, we also discovered that we are not the only open
source project that got our advertising blocked by ad blockers. Many
open source projects that fund themselves through advertising get
blocked and some of them don't have the resources to navigate the
acceptable ads program or understand the inner workings of ad blockers.</p>
<p>Likewise, some web users may not want to allow all acceptable ads which
includes many ads from the big networks but we are hoping they would be
willing to accept ads that benefit their community of software
developers.</p>
<p>We are launching a <strong>new initiative</strong> to <a href="https://ads-for-open-source.readthedocs.io">allow advertising that
benefits open source
software</a>. We encourage you
to subscribe to the this list and support open source. If you run an
open source project affected by ad blockers, we would love to help you
too.</p>
